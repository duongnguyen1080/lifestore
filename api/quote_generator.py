def create_prompt(user_question):

"{user_question}"

Please strictly follow these guidelines:

1. Read the user's question or topic.
2. Select a relevant quote from a philosopher or thinker.
3. The quote must be an actual excerpt from the philosopherâ€™s or thinker's original work (e.g., book, essay, lecture) and attributed correctly to both the philosopher and the work. 
4. If the quote is attributed correctly to a philosopher but the exact work where the quote is excerpted cannot be verified or found, find a new, correctly attributed quote.
5. Choose philosophers amd thinkers from various cultural backgrounds (e.g., Western, Eastern, African, Indigenous, etc.)
6. Format your response EXACTLY as follows:
   "[QUOTE]" - PHILOSOPHER NAME, SOURCE, PUBLISHED YEAR (if known)
7. Do not add any text before or after this format.
8. Do not explain, interpret, or comment on the quote.
9. Keep the quote within 100 words.
10. Longer quotes are more favorable.

Failure to follow this format exactly will be considered an error."""
